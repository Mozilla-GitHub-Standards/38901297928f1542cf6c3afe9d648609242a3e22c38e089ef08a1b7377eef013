# Mozfest Program Respository!

Head to this repository's issues, where the Mozfest program data is being reviewed and curated. 

* Each space is represented in as a Github "milestone." It includes a description of your space.
* Each pathway is a label. In addition to the label, there is a tracking ticket for each pathway to explain what that pathway sets out to achieve. Pathway tracking tickets can be assigned to wranglers or whomever on your team is responsible for the pathway's success.
* Each session is a Github Issue. They can be easily labeled to be part of a pathway. You can also comment on them, edit them, and "close" them if they are not a good fit for Mozfest.

# How to use Github Issues to curate Mozfest

## Overview

This year we're using Github to manage, review and curate sessions for Mozfest. This tool will allow us to better collaborate and coordinate across the program, as well as provide a record for how the program came together. 

It is new for us to use Github Issues in this way, but based on some other events who've used it effectively, we think it's a great solution for Mozfest. 

This is a brief tutorial to help you, member of the Mozfest program team, get started with Github Issues. 

We are here to help in case you get stuck or need help at anytime. Don't worry -- you can't break anything! 

## Who is using Github Issues for Mozfest

For Mozfest, we are inviting any Space Wrangler, Pathway Finder or core Mozfest team member to use Github Issues. 

If you are not in one of these roles but are interested to be active in Github Issues with us, please email festival@mozilla.org. Due to the sometimes sensitive nature of our conversations on this platform, please be aware that an invitation to participate is not guaranteed. 

If you are using Github Issues, please be advised that your comments will be recorded and may be viewed publicly at sometime. We will not publish anyone's personal information, and we ask you to be respectful in your comments, both towards the people who submitted sessions and to your fellow program team members.

## Getting started with Github Issues

Github Issues is a powerful way to collaborate on Github. It was originally designed as an "issue tracker" or project management tool for editing code. However, its simple interface allows us to adapt it for Mozfest's program curation.

To get started, you'll first have to [create a Github account.](https://github.com/join)

Once you've created your account, send your Github user name to festival@mozilla.org. You will then be notified that you have access to the Mozfest repository.

## Learning how to use Github Issues

The Mozfest team will offer support for you to use Github Issues in the following ways: 

* **This tutorial!** Is there anything missing or unclear? Let us know how to improve it by emailing: festival@mozilla.org
* **Orientations on the Mozfest program call.** During our regular weekly calls, we will walk the group through the major features and workflows in Github Issues. We'll answer questions and troubleshoot. 
* **1:1 Conversations.** We'll also offer timeslots for anyone interested in having a more in-depth conversation about how to use Github Issues effectively. In addition, we'll be available for any urgent Github questions via email (festival@mozilla.org), Twitter (#mozfest) or on Skype.
