# mozfest-program

Head to this repository's issues, where the Mozfest program data is being reviewed and curated. 

* Each space is represented in as a Github "milestone." It includes a description of your space.
* Each pathway is a label. In addition to the label, there is a tracking ticket for each pathway to explain what that pathway sets out to achieve. Pathway tracking tickets can be assigned to wranglers or whomever on your team is responsible for the pathway's success.
* Each session is a Github Issue. They can be easily labeled to be part of a pathway. You can also comment on them, edit them, and "close" them if they are not a good fit for Mozfest.
